# Speak And Spell

This is a quick 'Speak-and-Spell' style game in C.

It uses the audio samples assembed by Maxim Porges, at:
http://www.maximporges.com/2011/10/08/speak-and-spell-samples/

type 'make' to build.
run it with './sas'

By default it reads from an attached keyboard, but can work with my
'voice keyboard' project.
Run it with './sas nokb' for this (i.e. 'no keyboard')

also, with the voice-keyboard program, 
make sure you have trained the 'Enter' key and the 'shift-B' key (as a
'backspace' key) to allow recognition mistakes to be corrected.
